# Two Servers Simulation with Python

This Python script simulates a system with two servers. It performs the following tasks:

1. Generates a detailed table using PrettyTable to display simulation results.
2. Exports the table to an Excel file using Pandas.
3. Calculates the percentage of time each server was busy and the average waiting time.
4. Displays a countplot showing the delay in service using Seaborn.

## How to Use

1. **Set Probabilities:**
   - Add the cumulative probabilities for the inter-arrival time.
   - Add the service time probabilities for the servers.

2. **Adjust Call Numbers:**
   - You can control the number of calls by specifying the number of random numbers generated (default is 100).

3. **Run the Application:**
   - Execute the Python script in your preferred environment.
